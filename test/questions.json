Why is a <code>Fragment</code> reference maintained and recreated when it is supposed to be part of that <code>Activity</code> which is supposedly <strong>completely</strong> destroyed and recreated? I can justify that by <code>Fragment</code>s intentionally being separate to activities. But what was causing the issues, is <strong>why</strong> is the original <code>Fragment</code> attached and recreated <strong>before</strong> the <code>Activity</code> is? It just doesn't seem to follow the logical lifecycle that the rest of the Android process does.</p>\n","title":"Activity and Fragment Lifecycles and Orientation Changes","tags":["android","android-fragments","android-activity","android-lifecycle"],"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"view_count":6,"owner":{"user_id":1386784,"display_name":"B T","reputation":304,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39b15435a7e7cc9caaf391bff829f2d5?d=identicon&r=PG","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/1386784/b-t","accept_rate":80},"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14595946/activity-and-fragment-lifecycles-and-orientation-changes","is_answered":false},{"question_id":14595945,"creation_date":1359514648,"last_activity_date":1359514648,"score":0,"answer_count":0,"body":"<p>I'm loading a YAML file in Ruby, and want to do something depending on if a parameter in the YAML file is given.

It takes about 30 seconds, even just to open the most trivial activity. Dalvik VM seems to do a LOT of garbage collecting for unknown reason. Please check <code>logcat</code> output below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>01-30 02:06:27.025: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 3889 objects / 221200 bytes in 45ms\n01-30 02:06:28.234: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 2784 objects / 76864 bytes in 48ms\n01-30 02:06:29.614: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 2665 objects / 70088 bytes in 64ms\n01-30 02:06:30.915: D/BrowseActivity(553): Low memory status: false\n01-30 02:06:30.915: D/BrowseActivity(553): Low memory threshold (KB): 16384\n01-30 02:06:30.915: D/BrowseActivity(553): Memory available (KB): 451348\n01-30 02:06:31.095: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_EXTERNAL_ALLOC freed 2711 objects / 85904 bytes in 62ms\n01-30 02:06:49.705: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 8894 objects / 600272 bytes in 89ms\n01-30 02:06:50.414: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 10757 objects / 730720 bytes in 68ms\n01-30 02:06:51.105: D/dalvikvm(553): GC_FOR_MALLOC freed 10251 objects / 694864 bytes in 67ms\n... and about 30 more garbage collection messages\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I already experimented with lower number of records: 1 and 300. It results in a much fewer garbage collection messages (1 and 7, respectively) and a much faster activity load (1 and 6 seconds, respectively), but the memory availability difference is quite trivial:</p>\n\n<pre><code>01-30 02:03:35.295: D/BrowseActivity(491): Low memory status: false\n01-30 02:03:35.295: D/BrowseActivity(491): Low memory threshold (KB): 16384\n01-30 02:03:35.295: D/BrowseActivity(491): Memory available (KB): 453184\n\n01-30 02:04:53.494: D/BrowseActivity(522): Low memory status: false\n01-30 02:04:53.494: D/BrowseActivity(522): Low memory threshold (KB): 16384\n01-30 02:04:53.494: D/BrowseActivity(522): Memory available (KB): 453152\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It seems that the slow activity load time is caused by GC overheads. My question is: Why does Dalvik VM does a lot of GC? Even with 3000 records, I believe it would only take top 500 KB in memory.

I am trying to figure out how to use clang in its place in my build system.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note that I figured out the answer to my own question while writing it but I am still posting it in case it is useful to anyone else. Alternative answers are also welcome.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Details</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I have a build process which first generates bitcode using <code>clang++ -emit-llvm</code>.  Then I take the bitcode files and link them together with <code>llvm-link</code>.  Then I apply some standard optimization passes with <code>opt</code>.  Then I apply another custom compiler pass with <code>opt</code>.  Then I apply the standard optimization passes again using <code>opt</code> a third time.  Finally I take the output from the last run of <code>opt</code> and use <code>llvm-link</code> to link with appropriate libraries to generate my executable.  When I tried to replace <code>llvm-link</code> with <code>clang++</code> in this process I get the error message: <code>file not recognized: File format not recognized</code></p>\n\n<p>To make this question more concrete I created a simplified example of what I am trying to do.  First there are two files that I want to compile and link together</p>\n\n<p><strong>test1.cpp:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint getNum();\n\nint main()\n{\n  int value = getNum();\n  printf(\"value is %d\\n\", value);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>test2.cpp</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>int getNum()\n{\n  return 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I executed the following sequence of commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ -emit-llvm -c test1.cpp test2.cpp\nllvm-link -o test.bc1 test1.o test2.o \nopt test.bc1 -o test.bc2 -std-compile-opts\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>(Note that I am currently running llvm 3.1, but I'm trying to figure out the steps that will work for llvm 3.2.  I assume that I should be able to make the LLVM 3.1 version work correctly using clang instead of llvm-ld)</em></p>\n\n<p>Then if I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>llvm-ld test.bc2 -o a.out -native\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>everything is fine and <code>a.out</code> prints out 5.</p>\n\n<p>However, if I run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ test.bc2 -o a.out\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I get the error message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>test.bc2: file not recognized: File format not recognized clang-3:\nerror: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously I know that I can produce an executable file by running clang directly on the .cpp files.  But I'm wondering what the best way to integrate <code>clang</code> with <code>opt</code> is.</p>\n","title":"How to replace llvm-ld with clang?","tags":["llvm","clang","ld"],"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"favorite_count":0,"view_count":2,"owner":{"user_id":937324,"display_name":"Gabriel","reputation":949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ab80f21f95e8925c23e9a847157c20b?d=identicon&r=PG","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/937324/gabriel","accept_rate":85},"answers":[{"question_id":14595906,"answer_id":14595907,"creation_date":1359514340,"last_activity_date":1359514340,"score":0,"is_accepted":false,"owner":{"user_id":937324,"display_name":"Gabriel","reputation":949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ab80f21f95e8925c23e9a847157c20b?d=identicon&r=PG","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/937324/gabriel","accept_rate":85}}],"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14595906/how-to-replace-llvm-ld-with-clang","is_answered":false}],"quota_remaining":245,"quota_max":300,"has_more":true}
